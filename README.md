# arcade
Tek2-Project at Epitech Berlin to learn object oriented programming

Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of
player scores.

To be able to deal with the elements of your gaming plateform at run-time, your graphics libraries and your games
must be implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at runtime.

Each GUI available for the program must be used as a shared
library that will be loaded and used dynamically by the main
program.

Usage: ./arcade [graphical library]

all libraries can be found in the libs/ folder
